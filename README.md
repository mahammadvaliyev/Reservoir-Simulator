# Reservoir-Simulator

### Repository contains Matlab code for 1D single phase reservoir simulator.

- main file walks through the diagnostics tests done to the code and set of simple demo cases demonstrating accuracy and functionality of code.
- const_Pwf file corresponds to code for solving pressure values when the wells are operated under constant bottomhole pressure.
- const_q file corresponds to code for solving pressure values when the wells are operated under constant flowing rate.
- tridiag file corresponds to code for solving tridiagonal matrix systems using Thomas algorithm.
