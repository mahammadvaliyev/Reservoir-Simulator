# Reservoir-Simulator

Repository contains Matlab code for 1D single phase reservoir simulator.

Main file walks through the diagnostics tests done to the code and set of simple demo cases demonstrating accuracy and functionality of code.
Const_Pwf file corresponds to code for solving pressure values when the wells are operated under constant bottomhole pressure.
Const_q file corresponds to code for solving pressure values when the wells are operated under constant flowing rate.
Tridiag file corresponds to code for solving tridiagonal matrix systems using Thomas algorithm.
